# App Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to restore the Momentum AI application to its original design and functionality, while maintaining the recent backend upgrades, including the integration with Firebase and the secure Gemini API.

## Plan

1.  **Restore Glassmorphism:** Re-apply the `backdrop-blur-xl` class to the `Card` component to bring back the original glassmorphism effect.
2.  **Fix Linting Errors:** Address all linting errors in `src/App.jsx` to ensure code quality and stability. This includes removing unused imports, fixing hook dependencies, and resolving any other reported issues.
3.  **Reinstate Original Functionality:** I will carefully review the original code and the current version to identify and restore any missing functionalities. This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   **Data Management:** Ensure that the import/export functionality for user data is working as expected.
    *   **Bioage Analysis:** Verify that the bioage calculation and display are functioning correctly.
    *   **Cycle Sync:** Confirm that the menstrual cycle tracking feature is operational for female users.
4.  **UI/UX Polish:** I will perform a final review of the UI to ensure that it matches the original design and that the user experience is seamless and intuitive.

By following this plan, I will bring the application back to its intended state, combining the best of the original design with the enhanced backend functionality.
